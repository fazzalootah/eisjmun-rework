            The abbreviation "MUN" refers to "Model United Nations" conferences. Although, a well-rounded view of the United Nations is essential to grasp the spirit of MUN. Most of the world's nations are members of the United Nations, an international organization. Keeping everyone's best interests in mind, this worldwide group was formed to debate, cooperate, and solve the most pressing issues related to the violation of sovereignty, social autonomy, the danger of tyranny, and the eradication of oppression. The model United Nations (MUN) is an offshoot of the original United Nations. Instead of countries addressing issues, you do it at the Model United Nations.
