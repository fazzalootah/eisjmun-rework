            Emirates International School - Jumeirah's Model United Nations (EISJMUN) is the perfect place to discuss global issues. Segmenting committees helps confine conversations, but you may use your creativity, enthusiasm, and zeal to address socio-environmental concerns like nuclear power, human rights abuses in the Horn of Africa, and global economic recessions. With a talented secretariat team, a resilient executive team and a dedicated admin team, the only element missing from EISJMUN 2023 is your distinct participation.Â We are proud to have over a dozen committees, from the General Assemblies to our own NSNS. However, many external circumstances impact whether a Model UN meeting is excellent. We are delighted to present a spectacular social venue for all attendees to come during our conference to make it unforgettable!
